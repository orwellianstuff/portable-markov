# Orwell's Patent Portable Markov-in-a-box Generator

## Marketing speech

Have you always wanted to have a source of indisputably wondrous quotes in your palms? **Now you can have it!**

With **Orwell's Patent Portable Markov-in-a-box Generator**, you can have all the wisdom you will ever need. Simply fetch a source or two of your finest philosophical texts, ingest them, and soon you will have a script that will tell you any pertinent factoid, at any time.

Lots of tuning options exist, to suit all tastes and texts. **Order now!**

## Technical explanation and requirements

To run this script, you will require a relatively modern version of Ruby, which has Base64, JSON and Zlib in its standard libraries. You will also need, as above, suitable source texts for generation.
Once the script finishes, you have a simple script that prints out a random sample from the Markov chain built into the file.

You can adjust several options; the token recall memory length (from how long sequence of tokens we calculate the probability of the next one from), sentence tokenization (classic Markov chains look at characters directly, but sentence tokenization can create better results), newline stripping (can be useful for some source texts), and compression (by default, output scripts are compressed).

Usage: portable-markov.rb [options] name output_filename file1 [file2 ...]
	-level=<number of tokens to recall> -- How many tokens' recall we want to have?
	-sentences -- Shall we try to split according to sentences?
	-strip -- Shall newlines be stripped from the dictionaries?
	-uncompressed -- Save without compression?
